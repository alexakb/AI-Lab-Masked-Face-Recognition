# Masked-Face-Recognition-Challenge
This Repo was created to attend to the Webface260M Masked Face Recognition Challenge.
In this session, I used the Retinaface-Resnet50 model for face detection task and a pretrained weights of the model Resnet34 for recognition task.
The model Resnet34 was built based on Insigntface team and Deepface.
