# Masked-Face-Recognition-Challenge
This Repo was created for the Webface260M Masked Face Recognition Challenge project.
In this session, I used the Retinaface-Resnet50 model for face detection task and a pretrained weights of the model Resnet34 for recognition task.

The model Arcface is based on the implementation of Insightface with Keras version of PeteryuX and Deepface: https://github.com/peteryuX/arcface-tf2. 

The model Resnet34 was built based on Insightface team: https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/recognition.
